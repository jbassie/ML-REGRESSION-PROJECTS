# PROJECT OVERVIEW
Female-headed households have been on the rise in South Africa in recent years. Compared to male-headed households, female-headed households tend to face greater social and economic challenges. Female-headed households, in general, are more vulnerable to lower household incomes and higher rates of poverty.

The South African census collects data on female headship and income levels of every household across the country every 10 years. However, it is important for policymakers and other actors to have accurate estimates of these statistics even in between census years. This project explores how machine learning can help improve monitoring key indicators at a ward level in between census years.

The objective of this project is to build a predictive model that accurately estimates the percentage of households per ward that are female-headed and living below a particular income threshold, by using data points that can be collected through other means without an intensive household survey like the census.
